# Image-Clustering-Meanshift-Algorithm

Takes image as input and applies Mean shift algorithm which clusters pixels by color. Outputs information about processing time as well as a plot of pixels reprsented as data points in a 3-dimensional space as well as a comparison of original image vs. clustered image.
